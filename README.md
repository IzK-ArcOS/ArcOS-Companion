You ever need a way to access your ArcOS stuff on the go? How about using the custom-made, Android app for ArcOS!

ArcOS Companion's goal is to allow for users to connect with their (possibly) many users on different apis all in one place.

## Questions and Answers
### Is this a replacement for ArcOS?
No! Not even close. It's a tool to work alongside the current ArcOS web app.

### What can it do?
- [x] Add, create, or delete different apis
- [x] Check messages from saved apis
- [ ] Help you with emotional pain

### Why was this made?
A harsh way to word it, but it was made to convenience users with managing things on ArcOS on mobile. You want to message someone on the go? No problem here!

### Why isn't it available on iPhone? Will it be available at some point?
Due to limited hardware, it is not possible to work on an iPhone version at this time.
The hopes are that an iPhone version can be made and distributed on the App Store.

### I'm having issues with the app. Where do I go?
Well for starters, you can always message to the ArcOS discord.
If you still are having issues or don't trust people,
you can go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Blockyheadman/ArcOS-Companion/issues) page
and explain your issue there. Then it can be handled from there.

### I want to suggest a feature for the app. What do I do?
The [Issues](https://github.com/Blockyheadman/ArcOS-Companion/issues) tab once more!
You can submit a new issue there for a feature request and it will be reviewed and determined
if it's going to be added or not.
